The wine dataset consists of 178 samples of wines derived from three different cultivars, all grown in the same region in Italy. The goal is to classify the wines into one of three classes using chemical analysis of 13 different properties. Na√Øve Bayesian Classification was used to build a model that consistently achieved high accuracy, ranging from 97% to 100% with different random states. This indicates that the model is able to correctly classify the wines based on their properties, providing a reliable way to differentiate between the three cultivars.
